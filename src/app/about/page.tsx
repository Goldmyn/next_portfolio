        Back in 2019, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Web pages and
        tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development.
        Fast-forward to today, and I have had the privilege of building software
        for an international admission agency, a start-up, and a personal
        digital product.

        Currently, my primary focus is on building accessible user interfaces. I
        take great pleasure in crafting software that exists at the intersection
        of design and engineering—where aesthetics meet functionality. It Is
        fulfilling to create digital experiences that not only look appealing
        but also operate seamlessly beneath the surface.

        When I am not immersed in coding, I enjoy reading, spending quality time
        with my family, or engaging in spirited discussions with my tech-savvy
        friends. I also find myself roaming around the city in search of design
        inspiration, often marveling at the creativity that surrounds us—
